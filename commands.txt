HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)
	- used for transferring data over the internet.
	- HTTP  - the data is not encrypted. Easy to leak information
	- HTTPS - incorporates SSL / TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security) to
		  encrypt data during transmission. The SSL/TLS protocols include a process of server
		  authentication. This means that when you connect to a website over HTTPS, the 
		  browser verifies the authenticiity of the website's SSL certificate. This helps 
		  ensure you are communicating with the legitimate server.

OPEN SSL 
	- a software library for applications that provide secure communications over computer
	  networks, used from servers and most HTTPS websites.
	- contains open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols, written in C.
